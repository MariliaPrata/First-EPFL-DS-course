The EPFL first course project is made up of five tasks A to E:

A. An overview of the dataset

B. Exploration: numerical summaries, indexing and grouping

C. Exploration: visualizations

D. Probabilities

E. Matrices


Project Structure:

Repository/
├── p1_communes.csv

└── communes_solution.ipynb 

My impressions as a non-coder beginner: that was my longer Notebook ever, indexing many times required fixing (aka reading the same csv multiple times).
Very likely, there is a professional way to perform that in a much simpler way.

As a first project, I'm learning many things as working with the environments and even with Git/GitHub.

It was a pleasant experience, I hope you'll enjoy it, as I did.

Many thanks.
